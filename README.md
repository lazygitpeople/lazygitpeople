# 🤖 LazyGitPeople - GitHub Profile Automation

## What is LazyGitPeople?

LazyGitPeople is a service that helps developers maintain an active GitHub presence through scheduled, automated commits. Our bot creates meaningful code contributions, documentation updates, and project enhancements on your behalf, all clearly marked as automated.

## Benefits

- **Maintain Consistent Activity**: Keep your GitHub contribution graph active even during busy periods
- **Showcase Skills**: Our automated commits demonstrate code in languages you're proficient in
- **Portfolio Building**: Generate starter projects and code samples in your repositories
- **Transparent Automation**: All commits are clearly marked as automated - no deception involved

## How It Works

1. **You invite our bot**: Add @lazygitpeople as a collaborator to repositories you want to automate
2. **We schedule commits**: Our system generates code changes at configurable intervals
3. **Transparent processes**: All automated commits are clearly labeled with a 🤖 bot indicator
4. **You maintain control**: Cancel the service anytime by removing the bot's access
