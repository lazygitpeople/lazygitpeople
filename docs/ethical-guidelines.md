# Ethical Guidelines for LazyGitPeople

At LazyGitPeople, we believe in transparent and ethical automation. Our service helps developers maintain GitHub activity, but we recognize the importance of honest representation and ethical use of automation tools. These guidelines outline our commitment to ethical practices.

## Our Core Ethical Principles

### Transparency

We are committed to full transparency in our automation:

1. **Marked Automation**: Every commit generated by our system is clearly marked with a ðŸ¤– bot indicator.
2. **Explicit Footer**: Each commit message includes a footer stating: "This commit was automatically generated by LazyGit."
3. **Public Documentation**: We maintain public documentation about how our service works.
4. **Bot Account**: We use a dedicated bot account (@lazygitpeople) rather than impersonating human users.

### User Control

Users maintain full control over the automation:

1. **Explicit Permission**: We only operate on repositories where we've been explicitly invited as a collaborator.
2. **Immediate Termination**: Users can immediately stop all automation by removing collaborator access.
3. **Customization**: Users can specify what kinds of changes are acceptable.
4. **Data Limitation**: We only access the specific repositories we've been invited to.

### Quality Standards

We maintain quality in our automated contributions:

1. **Functional Code**: All generated code is syntactically correct and follows standard conventions.
2. **Meaningful Changes**: We avoid nonsensical or purely cosmetic changes.
3. **Contextual Awareness**: Generated code attempts to match the style and purpose of the repository.
4. **Beneficial Additions**: We focus on adding documentation, examples, and demonstrations that add value.
5. **Tiered Quality**: We offer different quality tiers (basic, mid-tier, and high-tier) to match your subscription plan, with higher tiers providing more sophisticated and comprehensive contributions.

### Project Generation Ethics

Our project generation feature follows these ethical principles:

1. **Educational Purpose**: Generated projects are meant for learning, demonstration, and portfolio building.
2. **Customization**: Users can customize projects to align with their skills and professional goals.
3. **Transparent Generation**: All generated projects include comments indicating AI assistance.
4. **User Ownership**: You maintain full ownership of generated projects with the right to modify them as needed.
5. **No Plagiarism**: Generated projects avoid direct copying of existing copyrighted codebases.

## Recommended Ethical Usage

We recommend these ethical practices for our users:

### Transparency with Others

1. **Be Honest**: If asked directly, be transparent about using automation tools to supplement your GitHub activity.
2. **Portfolio Context**: For portfolio projects, consider adding a note in the README acknowledging the use of automation tools.
3. **Interview Honesty**: Don't claim automated work as manual effort in job interviews or professional contexts.

### Appropriate Repository Selection

1. **Ideal Use Cases**:
   - Personal learning repositories
   - Portfolio demonstration projects
   - Template repositories
   - Documentation projects

2. **Inappropriate Use Cases**:
   - Production codebases
   - Team projects without team knowledge
   - Open source projects with other contributors
   - Critical infrastructure repositories

### Supplemental Not Replacement

Our service is designed to supplement, not replace, your genuine development work. We recommend:

1. **Balanced Activity**: Combine automated commits with your actual development work.
2. **Skill Development**: Use the automated examples as learning opportunities.
3. **Gradual Transition**: As your development skills and time availability increase, reduce reliance on automation.

## Our Ethical Commitments

As a service provider, we commit to:

1. **Never Misleading**: We will never claim or imply that automated work represents human effort.
2. **Continuous Improvement**: We regularly review and enhance our ethical guidelines.
3. **Community Standards**: We follow GitHub community standards and terms of service.
4. **User Education**: We educate users about appropriate and inappropriate uses of our service.
5. **Feedback Openness**: We welcome feedback on ethical considerations and adjust our practices accordingly.
