# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What exactly is LazyGitPeople?
LazyGitPeople is a GitHub automation service that creates scheduled commits to your repositories to maintain an active GitHub profile. Our service generates code changes, documentation updates, and other contributions that appear on your GitHub activity graph.

### Is this against GitHub's Terms of Service?
No. GitHub allows automation tools and bots. However, we follow ethical practices by clearly marking all automated commits. GitHub's terms prohibit misrepresentation, which is why we're transparent about automation.

### How much does this service cost?
Please contact us at support@lazygitpeople.com for current pricing. We offer different tiers based on commit frequency and customization needs.

## Usage Questions

### How do I start using LazyGitPeople?
Add our bot (@lazygitpeople) as a collaborator to your repository with Write permissions. We'll accept the invitation and begin scheduled commits based on the default schedule.

### Can I customize what kind of commits are made?
Yes. We offer customization for:
- Programming languages
- Commit frequency
- Types of changes (documentation, code improvements, new features)
- Project focus areas

Contact us for custom requirements.

### How do I stop the service?
Simply remove @lazygitpeople as a collaborator from your repository. All automation will immediately cease.

### Will the bot respond to issues or pull requests?
No. Our bot only creates commits. It does not engage in other GitHub activities like responding to issues, creating pull requests, or participating in discussions.

## Technical Questions

### What permissions does the bot need?
The bot requires Write access to your repository. This allows it to push commits but limits its access to only the repositories you've explicitly added it to.

### Does the bot access my private code?
We only access repositories where you've explicitly added @lazygitpeople as a collaborator. We do not access any other private repositories or information.

### How often will commits be made?
By default, 3-5 times per week on a randomized schedule to appear natural. Custom schedules are available.

### How does your system handle rate limits?
Our Cloudflare Workers architecture distributes operations globally to avoid GitHub API rate limits. We implement smart retry mechanisms and queue systems to ensure reliable operation.

### What happens if there's a conflict with my own commits?
Our system detects recent human commits and adjusts its operations to avoid conflicts. If conflicts do occur, the system will resolve them using GitHub's standard merge strategies.

### What cloud infrastructure do you use?
We use Cloudflare's global network, including Cloudflare Workers for processing, Cloudflare D1 for database storage, and Cloudflare Pages for our user interface. This provides a fast, secure, and globally distributed service.

## Ethical Questions

### Will people know these commits are automated?
Yes. All our commits contain a clear indicator (🤖) and a footer noting that the commit was automatically generated. We believe in transparency.

### Is this considered padding my GitHub profile?
We provide a legitimate service that creates actual code and documentation. However, we recommend being transparent about using our service if asked directly about your GitHub activity.

### Can I use this for work/professional repositories?
We strongly advise against using our service for professional, production, or team repositories. It's best suited for personal projects, portfolio demonstrations, and learning repositories.

### Is the code created by the bot high quality?
The code is syntactically correct and follows standard conventions, but it is generalized and may not follow specific project patterns. It's designed to demonstrate concepts rather than provide production-ready functionality.

## Support Questions

### What if there's an issue with a commit?
Contact us immediately at support@lazygitpeople.com. We can provide guidance on reverting problematic commits.

### Do you offer custom enterprise solutions?
Yes. For teams or companies interested in custom automation solutions, please contact our enterprise team at enterprise@lazygitpeople.com.

### How do I provide feedback?
We welcome all feedback at feedback@lazygitpeople.com or through our GitHub issues page.
