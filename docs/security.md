# Privacy & Security Practices

This document outlines the privacy and security measures implemented by LazyGitPeople to protect your GitHub repositories and data.

## GitHub Access & Permissions

### Repository Access

1. **Limited Access Scope**:
   - We only access repositories where explicitly invited as a collaborator
   - We request only the minimum permissions needed (Write access to repository content)
   - No access to sensitive repository settings or security features

2. **Repository Boundaries**:
   - We operate only within the specific repositories you authorize
   - No access to other repositories in your account
   - No organization-wide access unless explicitly granted

3. **Clear Access Control**:
   - You can immediately revoke access by removing the bot as a collaborator
   - All automation stops instantly when access is removed
   - No persistent access tokens stored for revoked repositories

## Data Handling

### Data Security

1. **Limited Data Collection**:
   - We collect only the minimum information needed to provide the service
   - Repository content is only temporarily accessed during commit operations
   - No long-term storage of your code or repository contents
   - Credit card information is verified but not stored directly on our servers

2. **Secure Processing**:
   - All operations occur in secure, isolated environments
   - Modern encryption used for all data in transit
   - Strict access controls for all systems

3. **Data Retention**:
   - Limited retention of operational logs (30 days)
   - No unnecessary storage of repository content
   - User configuration data retained only while service is active

## Operational Security

### Security Measures

1. **Authentication**:
   - Industry-standard authentication protocols
   - Regular rotation of service credentials
   - No use of permanent or long-lived tokens where avoidable

2. **Monitoring**:
   - 24/7 monitoring of service operations
   - Anomaly detection for suspicious activities
   - Proactive security scanning

3. **Incident Response**:
   - Dedicated security incident response team
   - Prompt notification process for security events
   - Regular security testing and reviews

## User Responsibilities

To maintain security when using our service:

1. **Repository Selection**:
   - Only add our bot to non-critical repositories
   - Don't use for production code or sensitive projects
   - Regularly review bot activity in your repositories

2. **Access Management**:
   - Periodically review collaborator access on your repositories
   - Remove access immediately if no longer needed
   - Don't grant more permissions than necessary

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Review automated commits regularly
   - Report any suspicious or unexpected behavior
   - Keep your own GitHub account secure with strong authentication

## Security Contacts

If you discover a security vulnerability or have security concerns:

- **Security Email**: security@lazygitpeople.com
- **Responsible Disclosure**: We offer a responsible disclosure program for security researchers

We take security seriously and continuously update our practices to maintain the highest level of protection for your repositories and data.
