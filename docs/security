# Security Practices

This document outlines the security measures implemented by LazyGitPeople to ensure the safety and integrity of your GitHub repositories and data.

## Authentication & Authorization

### GitHub Access Control

1. **Fine-Grained Personal Access Tokens (PATs)**:
   - Our service uses GitHub's fine-grained PAT system
   - Tokens are limited to only the specific repositories where invited
   - Only "Contents: Read & Write" permission is requested
   - No access to sensitive actions like managing webhooks or secrets

2. **Repository-Specific Access**:
   - We only access repositories where explicitly invited as a collaborator
   - No organization-wide permissions are ever requested
   - Repository access can be immediately revoked by removing the collaborator

3. **Token Security**:
   - PATs are rotated every 30 days
   - Each token has an explicit expiration date
   - No token is valid for more than 60 days under any circumstance

## Infrastructure Security

### Azure Security Architecture

1. **Key Vault Integration**:
   - All credentials stored in Azure Key Vault
   - Access controlled via Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
   - No credentials in code, configuration files, or environment variables

2. **Managed Identities**:
   - Azure Functions use system-assigned managed identities
   - No service principals or shared credentials
   - Identity-based authentication to all Azure services

3. **Network Security**:
   - Service endpoints restrict traffic to Azure services
   - IP restrictions limit access to function endpoints
   - All traffic uses HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ encryption

4. **Monitoring & Alerting**:
   - Real-time monitoring for suspicious activities
   - Alerts for unauthorized access attempts
   - Continuous security scanning of infrastructure

## Operational Security

### Secure Development Practices

1. **Code Security**:
   - Regular security code reviews
   - Static application security testing (SAST)
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - No secrets in source code

2. **Deployment Security**:
   - CI/CD pipeline security checks
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security validation
   - Least privilege principle for deployment credentials

3. **Access Control**:
   - Multi-factor authentication for all admin access
   - Just-in-time access for production systems
   - Separation of duties for critical operations

### Data Security

1. **Data Handling**:
   - We do not store your repository code permanently
   - Temporary clones are created in memory when possible
   - All local copies are securely deleted after operations complete
   - No data retention beyond necessary operational logging

2. **Logging**:
   - Logs contain only minimal metadata (repository name, operation time)
   - No source code or commit content in logs
   - Log retention limited to 30 days for operational troubleshooting

3. **Isolation**:
   - Each operation runs in an isolated environment
   - No cross-repository data sharing
   - Complete cleanup after each operation

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Management

1. **Response Plan**:
   - Documented incident response procedures
   - Designated security incident response team
   - Regular incident response exercises

2. **Notification Process**:
   - Prompt notification of affected users
   - Transparent communication about incidents
   - Clear remediation steps provided

3. **Post-Incident**:
   - Root cause analysis for all security incidents
   - Implementation of preventative measures
   - Updates to security practices based on lessons learned

## Compliance & Auditing

1. **Regular Assessments**:
   - Periodic security assessments and penetration testing
   - Third-party security reviews
   - Continuous compliance monitoring

2. **GitHub Policies**:
   - Strict adherence to GitHub terms of service
   - Compliance with GitHub's acceptable use policies
   - Regular review of GitHub security announcements

3. **Audit Trails**:
   - Comprehensive audit logs of all system activities
   - Immutable logging for security events
   - Regular audit log reviews

## Security Contacts

If you discover a security vulnerability or have security concerns:

- **Security Email**: security@lazygitpeople.com
- **Responsible Disclosure**: We offer a responsible disclosure program for security researchers
- **Emergency Contact**: For urgent security matters, contact our security team at +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX

We take security seriously and continuously update our practices to maintain the highest level of protection for your repositories and data.
